# mruby-ui

Bindings to [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui) for MRuby.

The api should be up to date & complete with respect to libui's master branch. Still, this is certainly "pre-release" software,
at best. Libui itself is still in alpha as well.

See the [class_bindigns.rb](https://github.com/jbreeden/mruby-ui/blob/master/mrblib/class_mappings.rb)
to get an overview of the classes and methods available. Or checkout some of the [examples](https://github.com/jbreeden/mruby-ui/tree/master/examples).

## Screenshots

These screenshots are from the control gallery example, which was ported from C to MRuby.
